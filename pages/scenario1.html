                <p style="font-size: 1.4em;">
                    Your company provides data information services to content providers who
                    primarily serve
                    customers on the internet. A new client provides content for a suite of lifestyle websites that
                    include cooking, travel, fitness, and health information. The client has consistent ad revenue,
                    mostly from a couple of sponsors that use the site to market their healthcare and lifestyle
                    products. Despite not having financial woes, the client has decided to downsize their content team
                    and wants to replace 40% of their image division with AI-generated content. This division produces
                    and places the images that appear in context with the articles posted by the text division. Your
                    team has been asked to work with the client to set up a process for their website that will feed AI
                    generated images directly to the remaining 3 members of the image division who will moderate and
                    then approve placement of the content. </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.4em;">
                    Your team has not worked directly with AI-generated content before, and your manager is excited
                    by the potential for future client contracts that might be possible. The legal team expressed some
                    concerns about how using AI-generated images might weaken the copyright held for published
                    content, but ultimately your team was given the green light to proceed. Now you are in the design
                    phase of building a rough interface for the image team to use so that they can view and approve the
                    AI-generated images. Meanwhile, you’ve been reading about the diﬀerent image generators available
                    in order to select one to test for this project. You start to develop concerns about the derivative
                    nature of AI generated images, and then you read about how real people employed as moderators
                    and reviewers of generated content have suﬀered as a result. You decide to share your concerns with
                    a team member, but this technology has them completely impressed. They tell you not to worry, that
                    the company has already thought of all these things and that you should let it go and just have fun
                    working on the project. At first you take their advice, until, one of the image team abruptly quits
                    their job after sending you a stern email about not being able to view any more images ‘like those.’
                    You aren’t sure what exactly caused the problem, but you now feel worried that you should have
                    brought your concerns to management sooner.
                    For this scenario, you should assume it is you, not a fictional character, that this scenario is
                    happening to. Then, using what you have learned from the readings and based on your own values
                    and experiences, you should create an email response to one of the following two possible
                    audiences:</p>
                <h4>Option 1: Email to a Former Professor</h4>
                <p>A favorite professor from your previous school reached out to you to see how you are liking
                    the job. You respond by describing the project described in the case, and then you share with your
                    previous instructor what concerns you have related to this project. You should expect to explain the
                    situation, identify your concerns, describe, and explain why those concerns are valid, discuss any
                    questions that you think you need to ask, and then volunteer what you see as the decision you must
                    make moving forward (if any).</h4>
                <h4>Option 2: Talk to Your Manager</h4>
                <p>You decide that you are uncomfortable carrying out this project without addressing some key
                    questions and concerns, and you decide to talk to your manager about it. Even though the project
                    has is underway, your goal is to try to get the manager to address the ethical questions that have
                    arisen for you and what impacts this project might have for the client, for your company, and
                    potentially the public. You will need to describe the aspects of the project that concern you or
                    raise questions for you, explaining why, and you will need to explain why you think there are
                    ethical issues in this project that need to be resolved.</p>
